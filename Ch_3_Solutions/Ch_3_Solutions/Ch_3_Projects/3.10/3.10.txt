The number of calls of factorial is approximately n.  Thus, the complexity of memory usage is O(n).

The number of calls of fibonacci active at any one time never exceeds the maximum depth of the call tree.  Therefore, since this depth is approximately equal to log base 2 of n, the complexity of memory usage is O(log n).
